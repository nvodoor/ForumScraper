Forum Scraper:

This is a project designed to scrape data off of forums, and then host them on an API.

To accomplish this project I did the following:

I created two custom modules to help me with scraping data off of forums.
I then created an app to use the modules to scrape the data and then insert it in a database.
I then created a flask API program to allow anyone to fetch the data.
